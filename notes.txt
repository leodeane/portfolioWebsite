being able to click the 3 lines

blurs the background; doesn't seem too hard to implement tbh

trying to get the project cards to look good on mobile, having trouble 
(check chatgpt logs lol)

FINALLY GOT THE CARDS TO CHANGE SIZES FOR MOBILE
(had to make just a small button instead of the whole card being a link)

changed talk to me button to just say resume to make resizing work

fixed hamburger button by increasing the hitbox on the bars

changed nav bar to be blurry underneath

need to do:
-link to my resume in nav bar

-add content for about section, add pic of me

-add content for projects section, upload projects to git
    -make new pages for each project

-change layout and content for footer

-work on projects link to send user to the projects section
    -(see chatgpt logs)
